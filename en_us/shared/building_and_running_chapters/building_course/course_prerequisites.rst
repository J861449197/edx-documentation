学生通过入学考试以后，他们可以访问所有已发布的课程资料。

To require an entrance exam, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, open your course.
#. On the **Settings** menu, select **Schedule & Details**.
#. On the **Schedule & Details** page, scroll to the **Requirements** section.
#. Select the **Require students to pass an exam before accessing course
   materials** check box.
#. At the bottom of the page, select **Save Changes**.

After you save your changes, Studio automatically creates an **Entrance Exam**
section in your course outline. To add content to your entrance exam, go to the
course outline.

==================================
Best Practices for Entrance Exams
==================================

We strongly recommend that you follow several guidelines to help you and your
students have a positive experience with entrance exams.

* Make sure that your beta testers include the entrance exam when they test
  your other course content.

* Make sure that you mention the entrance exam in the course description on
  your course About page. Otherwise, students will not know about the entrance
  exam before they enroll in your course and try to access course content.

* Add an anouncement at the top of the **Course Updates & News** page that
  contains information and instructions for students who need to take the exam.
  When students first try to access content in a course that has an entrance
  exam, they see the **Course Updates & News** page. We suggest that you
  include the following information.

  * To begin the course entrance exam, students click the **Entrance Exam** tab
    on the left side of the screen.

  * After students complete the entrance exam, they have to click the
    **Entrance Exam** tab again or refresh the page in their browser. When the
    page refreshes, students can see all currently available course content.

================================================
Create an Entrance Exam from the Course Outline
================================================

You create your course entrance exam from the course outline in Studio.
Creating entrance exam content is just like creating other course content. For
more information, see :ref:`Creating Course Content Index`.

==================================
Adjust Scores in the Entrance Exam
==================================

If you find an error in the exam after students have taken it, and corrections
to the exam are unavoidable, you have several options to rescore the exam for
individual students. These options are available on the Instructor Dashboard.

On the Instructor Dashboard, click **Student Admin**, and then scroll to the
**Entrance Exam Grade Adjustment** section. The following options are
available.

* **Reset Student Attempts**: Reset the value for one particular student's
  attempts back to zero so that the student can begin work over again. For more
  information, see :ref:`reset_attempts`.

* **Rescore Student Submission**: Rescore the responses that a student has
  submitted. For more information, see :ref:`rescore`.

* **Delete Student State for Problem**: Delete a student's entire history for
  the exam from the database. For more information, see :ref:`delete_state`.

Another option on the Instructor Dashboard is **Show Background Task History
for Student**. If you reset student attempts, rescore student submissions, or
delete student state, the operation runs in the background. If you want to see
a record of all the operations that have run for the entrance exam, select
**Show Background Task History for Student**.
