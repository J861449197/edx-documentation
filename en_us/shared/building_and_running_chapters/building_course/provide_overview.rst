#. Scroll down to the **Course Introduction Video** section.
#. In the field below the video box, enter the YouTube video ID (the code you
   copied in step 1). When you add the code, the video automatically loads in
   the video box. Studio automatically saves your changes.


.. _Set Course Time Requirements:

************************************
Set Course Time Requirements
************************************

To specify the number of hours that you expect students to spend on the course
each week, follow these steps.

#. From the **Settings** menu, select **Schedule & Details**.
#. Scroll down to the **Requirements** section.
#. In the **Hours of Effort per Week** field, enter the number of hours you
   expect students to work on this course each week.
#. View your course About page to see how the requirements will appear to
   students.


.. _Set Course Prerequisites:

********************************************
Set Course Prerequisites
********************************************

You might want to make sure that your students have a specific set of skills and
knowledge before they take your course. In addition to suggesting general
requirements in your course overview, you can require students to :ref:`complete
specific prerequisite courses<Specify Prerequisite Courses>`, or :ref:`take an
entrance exam<Require an Entrance Exam>`, or both.


.. _Specify Prerequisite Courses:

===================================
Specify Prerequisite Courses
===================================

You can require that your students pass a particular edX course before they
enroll in your course. Students see information about course prerequisites on
the course About page.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/PrereqAboutPage.png
  :width: 500
  :alt: A course About page with prerequisite course information circled

If students have not completed the prerequisite course, they can enroll in your
course and then see your course on the Student Dashboard. However, unlike with
other courses, the Student Dashboard does not provide a link to the courseware.
The Student Dashboard includes a link to the About page for the prerequisite
course. Students can enroll in the prerequisite course from the About page.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/Prereq_StudentDashboard.png
  :width: 500
  :alt: The Student Dashboard with an available course and a course that is
      unavailable because it has a prerequisite

To specify a prerequisite course, you must be a course author in both the
current course and in the prerequisite course.

#. In Studio, open your course.
#. On the **Settings** menu, select **Schedule & Details**.
#. On the **Schedule & Details** page, scroll to the **Requirements** section.
#. Under **Prerequisite Course**, click the drop-down list to select a course.
#. At the bottom of the page, select **Save Changes**.

.. note:: Currently, you can specify only one prerequisite course.


.. _Require an Entrance Exam:

===================================
Require an Entrance Exam
===================================

You can require your students to pass an entrance exam before they access your
course materials. If you include an entrance exam, students who enroll in your
course see only the **Entrance Exam** tab until they pass the exam.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/EntEx_LandingPage.png
  :width: 500
  :alt: The Entrance Exam page with the first problem visible

As students take the entrance exam, they can see their status at the top of
the page. After students pass the exam, they can access all released materials
in your course.

To require an entrance exam, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, open your course.
#. On the **Settings** menu, select **Schedule & Details**.
#. On the **Schedule & Details** page, scroll to the **Requirements** section.
#. Select the **Require students to pass an exam before accessing course
   materials** check box.
#. At the bottom of the page, select **Save Changes**.

After you save your changes, Studio automatically creates an **Entrance Exam** 
section in your course outline. To add content to your entrance exam, go to the 
course outline. 

Best Practices for Entrance Exams
********************************************

We strongly recommend that you follow several guidelines to help you and your
students have a positive experience with entrance exams.

* Make sure that your beta testers include the entrance exam when they test your
  other course content.

* Make sure that you mention the entrance exam in the course description on your
  course About page. Otherwise, students will not know about the entrance exam
  before they enroll in your course and try to access course content.

* On your course About page or in a course e-mail, include a link to the
  information about `entrance exams <http://doroob-student-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/latest/SFD_prerequisites.html#entrance-exam>`_ in the `edX Guide for Students <http://doroob-student- documentation.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_.


Create an Entrance Exam from the Course Outline
**************************************************

You create your course entrance exam from the course outline in Studio. Creating
entrance exam content is just like creating other course content. For more
information, see :ref:`Creating Course Content Index`.

Allow a Student to Skip the Entrance Exam
**************************************************

You can allow a student to skip the entrance exam. To do this, you need the
student's registered edX username or email address.

#. On the Instructor Dashboard, click **Student Admin**.
#. In the **Entrance Exam Adjustment** section, enter the student's
   information in the **Student's edX email address or username** field.
#. Under **Select an action for the student's entrance exam**, select
   **Let Student Skip Entrance Exam**.


Adjust a Student's Entrance Exam
********************************************

If you find an error in the exam after students have taken it, and corrections
to the exam are unavoidable, you have several options to rescore the exam for
individual students. These options are available on the Instructor Dashboard.

.. note:: You can only make exam adjustments for one student at a time.

On the Instructor Dashboard, click **Student Admin**, and then scroll to the
**Entrance Exam Grade Adjustment** section. The following options are available.

* **Reset Student Attempts**: Reset the number of attempts made for all problems
  in one student's exam to zero so that the student can begin work over again.
  For more information, see :ref:`reset_attempts`.

* **Rescore Student Submission**: Rescore the responses that a student has
  submitted. For more information, see :ref:`rescore`.

* **Delete Student's Answers and Scores**: Delete all of the student's answers
  and scores for the entire entrance exam so that the student can begin again.
  This action is sometimes called deleting a student's history or "deleting
  student state". For more information, see :ref:`Adjust_grades` and
  :ref:`delete_state`.

Another option on the Instructor Dashboard is **Show Background Task History
for Student**. If you reset student attempts, rescore student submissions, or
delete a student's answers and scores, the adjustment runs in the background
while you perform other tasks. To see a record of all completed entrance exam
adjustments, select **Show Student's Exam Adjustment History**.



.. _Set Important Dates for Your Course:

***********************************
Set Important Dates for Your Course
***********************************

You must set dates and times for enrollment and for the course.

#. In Studio, from the **Settings** menu, select **Schedule and Details**.  
#. Follow the on-screen text to enter the course and enrollment schedule.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/schedule.png
    :width: 450
    :alt: An image of the course schedule page.


.. note:: The **Time** fields on this page, and the times that students 
 see, use Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

.. _The Course Start Date:

=======================
The Course Start Date
=======================


.. note:: The default course start date is set far into the future, to
 **01/01/2030**. This is to ensure that your course does not start before
 you intend it to. You must change the course start date to the date you want
 students to begin using the course.

Students see the course start date and time on their **Current Courses**
dashboards and on the course About page. Students can see some parts of the
course before the course start date. For example, students can see your **Course
Info** page and course-wide discussion topics as soon as they enroll in your
course. For more information about course-wide discussion topics, see
:ref:`Create CourseWide Discussion Topics`.

The following example shows the course start date and time on the course About
page:

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/about-page-course-start.png
 :width: 600
 :alt: An image of the course About page, with the start date circled.

In the dashboard, students see the start dates and times for each of their
courses, as in the following examples.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/dashboard-course-to-start.png
 :width: 600
 :alt: An image of two courses in the student dashboard, with the start dates
     and times circled.

.. note:: If you do not specify a start time for your course, students see
   the default start time, 00:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).


.. _Set the Advertised Start Date:

======================================
Set the Advertised Start Date
======================================

You can set an advertised start date for your course that is different than the
course start date you set in the **Schedule and Details** page. You may want to
do this if there is uncertainty about the exact start date. For example, you
could advertise the start date as **Spring, 2014**.

To set an advertised start date:

#. From the **Settings** menu, select **Advanced Settings**.
#. Find the **Course Advertised Start Date** policy key. The default value is
   **null**.
#. Enter the value you want to display as the advertised start date. You can
   use any string, enclosed in double quotation marks. If you format the string
   as a date (for example, as 02/01/2014), the value is parsed and presented to
   students as a date.

  .. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/advertised_start.png
   :alt: Image of the advertised start date policy key with a value of "anytime,
       self-paced"

4. Click **Save Changes** at the bottom of the page.

The start date shown on the dashboard is now the value of the **Course
Advertised Start Date** policy key:

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/dashboard-course_adver_start.png
 :width: 600
 :alt: An image of a course listing in the student dashboard, with the
     advertised start date circled.

If you do not change the default course start date (01/01/2030), and the
**Course Advertised Start Date** policy value is ``null``, then the student
dashboard does not list a start date for the course. Students just see that
the course has not yet started.

.. _The Course End Date:

=====================
The Course End Date
=====================

The course end date is the date after which students can no longer earn credit
toward certificates. Students who have earned certificates can view them after
the course end date.

.. important::
 If you do not set a course end date, students will not be able to access
 earned certificates.

After grades and certificates are finalized, students see the course end date
on their personal **Current Courses** dashboards, as shown in the following
examples.

* If grades and certificates are not yet finalized, students can see the course
  end date and a message:

  .. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/dashboard-wrapping-course.png
   :alt: Image of a course on the student dashboard that has ended, but not
     been graded

* When grades and certificates are finalized, students who have not earned a
  certificate see their score and the score required to earn a certificate:
  
  .. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/dashboard-no-cert-course.png
   :alt: Image of a course on the student dashboard that has ended, but not
     been graded

* Students whose final score is equal to or higher than the required score can
  click **Download Certificate** to get their certificates as PDFs:
