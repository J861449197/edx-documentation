.. _Moderating Discussions for Cohorts:


##########################################################
管理有学生队列的论坛
##########################################################

在带有学生队列的课堂（下简称“分队课堂”）中管理讨论项目
分队功能启用后，每条帖子都会有个提示，表明该帖子的可见群体：
所有人，或者仅某一队列的成员。
对于学生而言，这个提示是分队课堂与普通课堂唯一可见的不同之处。 
您可以和学生一起研究 :ref:`Read the Cohort Indicator in Posts` 一节中的例子，
以及 :ref:`Discussions for Students and Staff` 一节的内容。


拥有讨论项目管理员、讨论项目协调员或助教身份的教职工也能通过提示语了解每条帖子的可见群体。
但是与学生不同，讨论项目的工作人员可以阅读所有帖子并有所建树，无论该帖出自哪个队列的学生之手。

.. note:: Course team members must have discussion moderator or admin
   privileges in addition to their course staff privileges to be able to view
   posts that are divided by cohort. For information about adding discussion
   privileges, see :ref:`Assigning_discussion_roles`.

   担任助教的学生也可以执行这些操作。

在分队课堂中，讨论项目的工作人员可以：

* 在分队讨论中发帖，并制定该帖的可见群体。详见
  :ref:`Choosing the Visibility of a Post`.

* 审核过滤“讨论”页面的帖子。详见 :ref:`Viewing the Posts of a Cohort Group`.
  
其他在 :ref:`Discussions` 一节中提到的功能、选项均对讨论项目工作人员开放。

确定某条帖子的可见群体
********************************

在分队课堂中，所有帖子的题目上方都有一行提示语。该提示语在学生/职工发帖后自动出现。
添加分队时，您需要非常小心地为分队命名，但是这条提示语无需设置。

或者，您也可以通过讨论课题名称告诉学生谁可以阅读他们的帖子。
详见 :ref:`Apply Naming Conventions to Discussion
Topics`.

.. _Read the Cohort Indicator in Posts:

==================================
阅读帖子的队列提示语
==================================

每条帖子上方都有一小句话，告诉大家谁可以阅读本帖并对本帖有所贡献，
是所有人，还是仅某一组的成员。下面是一个例子：

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/post_visible_all.png
 :alt: A discussion topic post with "This post is visible to everyone" above 
       the title

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/post_visible_cohort.png
 :alt: A discussion topic post with "This post is visible to" and a cohort name
       above the title

这条提示语出现在您发帖后。同样地，所有关于该帖的回复、评论也仅对提示语中的人群可见。

.. _Apply Naming Conventions to Discussion Topics:

=========================================================
为讨论课题应用命名约定
=========================================================

有时，课程团队成员可以在发布帖子之前就告知学生帖子的观众群体。
尤其是当某个小队之间的私人谈话非常敏感的时候，通过讨论课题名称告知帖子的可见群体非常重要。

例如，您可以在全课堂讨论课题名称中添加“(everyone)”字样（即“对所有人可见”）。

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/discussion_category_names.png
 :alt: The names you supply for course-wide topics in Studio appear on the 
       dropdown list of discussion topics in the live course

如此，当学生访问“讨论”页面，并在下拉列表中选择全课堂讨论课题时，
课题名就可以告知他们，哪些人能阅读帖子并发表回复和评论。

（在上图中，每个课题名都有（everyone）和（private）两种类型。
您需要清楚地辨别，哪些课题下的所有帖子是对所有人可见的）

更多关于添加、配置全课堂讨论课题的内容，请参见 :ref:`Create CourseWide Discussion Topics` 
和 :ref:`Specify Whether
CourseWide Discussion Topics are Cohorted`.

如果需要，您还可以为特殊讨论课题应用命名约定，这类课题通常在Studio里以讨论模块的形式加入。
例如，您可以在每个讨论模块的子类别名称中加入一条提示语，比如“(private)”或“(small group)”等。

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/discussion_topic_names.png
 :alt: The Subcategory name that you supply for a Discussion component in
       Studio appears on the dropdown lists of discussion topics in the live
       course

.. _Choosing the Visibility of a Post:

***************************************
选择帖子的可见性
***************************************

If you have the discussion admin, discussion moderator, or community TA role,
you can make posts to divided discussion topics visible to everyone who is
enrolled in the course or to the members of a selected cohort only. When
you :ref:`add a post<Add a Post>`, the **Visible to** dropdown list appears
above the **Title** field.

This example shows a new post being added to a content-specific
discussion topic.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/visible_to_contentspecific.png
 :alt: The fields and controls that appear when a staff member clicks 
       New Post for a content-specific topic

As a discussion staff member, you can choose the visibility of your posts in
topics that are divided by cohort. This means that you can add a single post
with information that you want everyone to see, rather than having to write a
separate post for each cohort. It also means that it is possible for you
to unintentionally share information with a different audience than you
intended.

.. note:: Students do not choose the visibility of their posts. The 
 visibility of student posts is determined by the configuration of the topic
 they post in. See :ref:`Finding Out Who Can See a Post`.

Posts that discussion staff members add to unified discussion topics are always
visible to all students, regardless of cohort assignment.

.. _Considerations When Editing Posts:

===================================
Considerations When Editing Posts
===================================

It may be helpful to keep these additional considerations in mind when you edit
posts in a course that includes cohorts.

* You cannot change the visibility of a post after it has been added. If you
  notice that a post contains information that is not appropriate for the
  cohort who can read it, edit the content of the post or delete the post.

* If you change the topic that a post appears in, the visibility of the post
  and its responses and comments **does not change**. This ensures that
  students who are following the post, or who have contributed responses or
  comments to it, will still be able to read it.

* All of the responses and comments that are contributed to a post will be
  visible to the same group of people as the post itself. You cannot change the
  visibility of individual responses or comments.

.. _Viewing the Posts of a Cohort Group:

*****************************
Viewing the Posts of a Cohort
*****************************

When a course includes student cohorts, you can view posts and monitor
discussion activity for one cohort at a time. You can also view all
posts.

.. note:: Course team members must have discussion moderator or admin
   privileges in addition to their course staff privileges to be able to view
   posts that are divided by cohort.

Above the list of posts on the **Discussion** page, the **in all cohorts**
filter is selected by default. You see every post when you make this selection,
as shown in the illustration on the left. To limit the list so that you can
view the same set of posts as the members of a cohort, select the name
of that cohort as shown on the right.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/viewing_all_or_cohort.png
 :alt: The list of posts on the Discussion page, first showing all posts then 
  showing only posts that members of the University Alumni cohort can see

Note that both of these lists include posts that are visible to
everyone. When you filter the list by cohort, you see the same, complete
set of posts that the members of the cohort see.

For other options that you can use to view posts, see :ref:`Find Posts`.
