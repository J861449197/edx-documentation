在有队列的课程中设置论坛
######################################################

在开启了队列的课程中，讨论主题可以按队列分类或统一对所有学生可见。
按队列分类的讨论主题对所有学生可见，但是帖子、回复和评论仅对队列成员可见。
统一讨论主题中的帖子、回复和评论对所有学生可见。

当您第一次在课程中开启队列时，
:ref:`course-wide discussion topics<Coursewide Discussion Topics and Cohorts>` 
的初始设定和 :ref:`content-specific discussion topics
<Content Specific Discussion Topics and Cohorts>` 的设定不同。

默认状态下，全课堂讨论主题是统一的，因为这些讨论一般是为课程中的所有学生都感兴趣的内容设置的。
相反，内容指定讨论主题是默认按队列分配的。在导师面板中，您可以更改讨论主题的类型。

.. warning:: 如果您在学生开始阅览和贡献讨论帖时，更改在线课程中讨论主题的队列设置，
   您将更改学生的课程体验。学生可能看到之前看不到的帖子，或者看不到以前能看到的帖子。
   如果您更改任何已开始课程的设置，请注意改变可能造成的影响。更多细节请参阅 :ref:`Altering Cohort Configuration` 。

.. note:: Making discussion topics divided by cohort, described in this and
   the following topics, only divides posts within the discussion topics by
   cohort; the discussion topics are still visible to all learners in the
   course. If you want to make specific content-specific discussion topics
   visible only to certain cohorts, you can implement content groups and
   change the visibility settings on the discussion components. For more
   details, see :ref:`Cohorted Courseware Overview`.


.. _Coursewide Discussion Topics and Cohorts:

***********************************************
Course-Wide Discussion Topics and Cohorts
***********************************************

When you first :ref:`create a course-wide discussion topic<Create CourseWide
Discussion Topics>`, it is unified, and all students in the course can post,
read, respond, and comment in the topic without regard to their cohort
assignments. 

After you add a course-wide topic, you can configure it so that it is divided by
cohort instead. For step-by-step instructions for specifying whether a course-
wide discussion topic is unified or divided by cohort, see :ref:`Specify Whether
CourseWide Discussion Topics are Cohorted`.

====================================================================
Example: Making Some Course-Wide Discussion Topics Divided by Cohort
====================================================================

Course-wide discussion topics are by default unified, so that all learners can
participate. In some instances, however, you might decide that it makes sense to
divide some course-wide discussion topics by cohort, so that members of each
cohort only see and respond to posts made by learners in the same cohort.

For example, in addition to the system-supplied General topic, you add three
new course-wide discussion topics, for a total of four discussion topics.

* General
* Course Q&A
* Announcements
* Brainstorming

The posts that you intend to make to the General and Course Q&A topics, and
the subjects you expect students to explore there, are appropriate for a
unified learner audience. However, you decide that it will be useful for the
Announcements and Brainstorming topics to be divided by cohort. For
information about specifying whether course-wide discussion topics are divided
by cohort, see :ref:`Specify Whether CourseWide Discussion Topics are
Cohorted`.

You also decide to apply a naming convention so that students will know the
audience for the discussion topics before they add any posts. For information
about naming conventions, see :ref:`Apply Naming Conventions to Discussion
Topics`.


.. _Specify Whether CourseWide Discussion Topics are Cohorted:

********************************************************************
Specify Whether Course-Wide Discussion Topics are Divided by Cohort
********************************************************************

When you :ref:`create course-wide discussion topics<Create CourseWide
Discussion Topics>`, they are by default unified, and all learners in the
course can see and respond to posts from all other learners. You can change
course-wide discussion topics to be divided by cohort, so that only members of
the same cohort can see and respond to each other's posts.

To change the cohort settings for course-wide discussion topics, follow these
steps.

#. In the LMS, select **Instructor**, then select **Cohorts**. 

#. Click **Specify whether discussion topics are divided by cohort**. 
   
#. In the **Course-Wide Discussion Topics** section, select the checkbox next to
   each course-wide discussion topic that you want to divide by cohort. Clear
   the checkbox next to each course-wide discussion topic that you want to make
   unified.
   
#. Click **Save**.
   
   The list of course-wide discussion topics is updated to show which topics are
   divided by cohort, and which are unified.

:ref:`Moderating Discussions for Cohorts`.


.. _Content Specific Discussion Topics and Cohorts:

**********************************************
Content-Specific Discussion Topics and Cohorts
**********************************************

When you enable the cohort feature for a course, and :ref:`create content-specific
discussion topics<Create ContentSpecific Discussion Topics>` by adding 
discussion components to units in Studio, these content-specific
discussion topics are by default divided by cohort. A student who is assigned
to one cohort cannot read or add to the posts, responses, or comments
contributed by the members of another cohort.

If you want all content-specific discussion topics in your course to be
divided by cohort, you do not need to take any action. For more information,
see :ref:`Specify that All ContentSpecific Discussion Topics are Cohorted`.

Alternatively, you can specify that you want most of the content-specific
discussion topics in your course to be unified, and make :ref:`only a few
discussion topics divided by cohort<Specify Some ContentSpecific Discussion
Topics as Cohorted>`.


.. _Specify that All ContentSpecific Discussion Topics are Cohorted:

*****************************************************************
Specify that All Content-Specific Discussion Topics are Cohorted
*****************************************************************

The default behavior for content-specific discussion topics is that they are
divided by cohort when you first :ref:`add them<Create ContentSpecific
Discussion Topics>` in your courseware. If you want all content-specific
discussion topics in your course to be divided by cohort, you do not need to
take any action.

You can confirm this setting on the Instructor Dashboard **Cohorts** tab. 

#. In the LMS, select **Instructor**, then select **Cohorts**. 

#. Click **Specify whether discussion topics are divided by cohort**. 

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/CohortDiscussionsSpecifyLink.png
 :alt: The link in the UI to specify whether content specific discussion topics are divided by cohort
   
In the **Content-Specific Discussion Topics** section, you see that the
**Always cohort content-specific discussion topics** option is selected. 

All content-specific discussion topics in your course are divided by cohort,
and you cannot change the cohort settings of individual content-specific
discussion topics.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/CohortDiscussionsAlwaysCohort.png
 :alt: Content specific discussion topics controls with the "Always cohort
  content specific discussion topics" option selected

For information about changing the cohort settings for your content-specific
discussions to make all of them unified except a few, see :ref:`Specify Some
ContentSpecific Discussion Topics as Cohorted`.


.. _Specify Some ContentSpecific Discussion Topics as Cohorted:

**************************************************************************
Specify that Some Content-Specific Discussion Topics are Divided by Cohort
**************************************************************************

The default behavior for content-specific discussion topics is that they are
divided by cohort when you first :ref:`add them<Create ContentSpecific
Discussion Topics>` in your courseware.

To make only a few of your content-specific discussion topics divided by
cohort, you change the cohort settings for content-specific discussion topics
to make them all unified, and then explicitly select only the topics that you
want to be divided by cohort.

.. warning:: When you change the cohort setting from **Always Cohort Content-Specific
   Discussion Topics** to **Cohort Selected Content-Specific Discussion Topics**, 
   you are making all content-specific discussion topics in your course unified, unless
   you explicitly change them to be divided by cohort before saving your changes. 
   This means that any posts that were previously divided by cohort and restricted to 
   viewing, responding, and commenting by members of the same cohort are now visible
   to all learners in your course. 

   If you make changes to cohort settings in a running course, be aware of the
   implications of your changes. For more details, see :ref:`Altering Cohort
   Configuration`.


To specify that only some content-specific discussion topics in your course are
divided by cohort, follow these steps.

#. In the LMS, select **Instructor**, then select **Cohorts**. 

#. Click **Specify whether discussion topics are divided by cohort**. 

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/CohortDiscussionsSpecifyLink.png
 :alt: The link in the UI to specify whether content specific discussion topics are divided by cohort
   
3. In the **Content-Specific Discussion Topics** section, if it is not already
   selected, select **Cohort selected content-specific discussion topics**.
   
   .. warning:: If you make changes to cohort settings in a running course, be
      aware of the implications of your changes. For more details, see
      :ref:`Altering Cohort Configuration`.

   All content-specific discussion topics that you add in your course are
   unified and visible to all learners. The list of content-specific
   discussion topics becomes editable.
   
#. Select the checkbox next to each content-specific discussion topic that you
   want to divide by cohort.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/CohortDiscussionsCohortSelected.png
     :alt: Content specific discussion topics controls with the "Cohort
      selected content specific discussion topics option selected
   
#. Click **Save**.
   
   The changes to your content-specific discussions are saved. The content-specific
   discussion topics that you selected are saved as being divided by cohort. All other
   content-specific discussion topics are unified.
