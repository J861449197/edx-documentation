You can add discussion components to a unit to pose questions related to the
unit and give students a chance to respond and interact on a specific subject.
Discussion topics that you create by adding discussion components in your
courseware are known as content-specific discussion topics.

We recommend that you add an HTML component before each discussion component
to introduce the topic that you want learners to discuss. The discussion
component itself does not contain any text and can be easy for learners to
overlook.

For more information about discussion components, see these topics.

* :ref:`Create a Discussion Component`
* :ref:`Visibility of Discussion Topics`
* :ref:`A Students View of the Discussion`


For more information about discussions in general, see these topics.

* :ref:`Guidance for Discussion Moderators`

.. note:: We recommend that you add an HTML component before each discussion
   component to introduce the topic that you want learners to discuss. The
   discussion component itself does not contain any text and can be easy for
   learners to overlook.

#. Under **Add New Component**, click **Discussion**.

#. In the discussion component that appears, click **Edit**.

#. Follow the guidelines in the editor to fill in the **Category**, the
   optional **Display Name**, and the **Subcategory** fields.

   The value in the **Display Name** field identifies the discussion in the
   course content. The values in the **Category** and **Subcategory** fields
   appear in the list of discussion topics on the **Discussion** tab. 

   .. note:: Each **Category**/**Subcategory** pair for the discussion topics
      in your course must be unique.

#. Click **Save**.

.. warning:: You should always use these steps to create a discussion
   component. Do not create discussion topics by using the **Duplicate**
   button in Studio. Duplicated discussion components will result in
   discussion topics containing the same conversations, even if users post in
   different discussions.

.. note:: On the *Discussion** tab, you cannot see category and subcategory
   names of discussion components that you created until after the course has
   started and the unit is released. For more details about when discussion
   topics are visible, see :ref:`Visibility of Discussion Topics`.


.. _A Students View of the Discussion:

**********************************
A Student's View of the Discussion 
**********************************

For students, the display name for the discussion component appears in the
learning sequence at the top of the page:

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/DiscussionComponent_LMS_Ribbon.png

     showing a discussion component

The discussion space appears under other components in the unit. It does not
have a label in the body of the unit. Instead, students see "Show discussion"
or "Hide discussion" on the left, and a blue **New Post** button on the right.

In the following example, the discussion component follows video and HTML
components:

In the **Discussion** tab at the top of the page, students can find the
category and subcategory of the discussion in the left pane.
