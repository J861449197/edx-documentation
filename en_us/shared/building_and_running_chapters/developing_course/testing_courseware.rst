.. _Testing Your Course Content:

###########################
测试您的课程内容
###########################

在Studio的在线课程中，学生和您看到的界面是不同的。

我们建议您建好课程后持续进行测试，这样您就可以和用学生的视角体验课程。

以下步骤测试您的内容：

* `Preview Course Content`_
* `View Your Live Course`_

.. note:: 
  如果您建立内容组将课程内容设置为部分学生可见，请参考 :ref:`Preview Cohort Specific
  Courseware`.

更多关于贝塔测试的内容请参考
:ref:`Beta_Testing`.

.. _Preview Course Content:

*************************
预览课程内容
*************************

您可以在课程上线或发布特定单元之前预览课程内容，这样您就可以审查课程将如何呈现在学生面前。
 
当您预览课程内容时，您将在Studio看到最新的课程内容。
您将看到单元的发布状态： :ref:`Draft
(Never Published)`、 :ref:`Draft (Unpublished Changes)` 或 :ref:`Visible to
Staff Only` 。

如果您使用内容小组并指定单元中的组件仅对特定小组可见，可见性状态指某些单元中的内容仅对特定小组可见。
更多关于预览仅对特定小组可见的课程内容，请参阅 :ref:`Preview Cohort Specific Courseware`.

例如，您可以 :ref:`publish a unit<Publish a Unit>` ，其中可以包含视频和讨论区。

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/test-unit-studio.png
 :alt: A unit in Studio with a video and discussion

学生在学习管理系统中将看到相同内容。

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/test-unit-lms.png
 :alt: A unit in the LMS with a video and discussion

如果您稍后决定在讨论之前往单元中添加多选题。
在发布修改之前，您可以通过预览单元查看该问题将如何呈现在学生界面。

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/test-unit-studio-added-comp.png
 :alt: A unit in Studio with a video and multiple choice problem. (The
   discussion component below the multiple choice problem is not included in
   the screen capture).

点击 **预览** 然后选择以 **学生** 视角浏览课程。您将看到学习管理系统中的单元包含的多选题。
预览中将呈现您在 :ref:`publish the
change<Publish a Unit>` 之后学生所看到的界面。

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/test-unit-lms-added-comp.png
 :alt: A unit in the LMS with "View as Student" selected, showing a video and
  a multiple choice problem. (The discussion component below the multiple
  choice problem is not included in the screen capture).

在线课程中，学生仍将看到原有的课程内容。只有您 :ref:`publish the change<Publish a Unit>` ，之后，学生才能看到多选题。

.. note:: When the unit's state is :ref:`Published and Live`, the preview and
   the live version of the courseware are exactly the same. Selecting either
   of **View Live** or **Preview** gives you the same view.


 
.. _View Your Live Course:

******************************************
查看在线课程
******************************************

When you are working in Studio, you can test your course by viewing it in the
LMS. In the LMS, you can see your course as a student sees it. You can see your
course in `Staff View`_ or `Student View`_. If you are using content groups to
designate specific content as visible only to particular content groups, you can
see your course as a content group would see it.

While you work in Studio, you can switch to your live course to see how your
course appears to students in two ways.

* From the outline page, click **View Live**.
   
  .. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/test-outline-view-live.png
   :alt: View live button on the outline

* In a unit page, click **View Live Version**.
   
  .. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/test-unit-view-live.png
   :alt: View Live Version button on the unit page

=================
Staff View
=================

You see the course in the **Staff View**.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/Live_Course_Staff_View.png
 :alt: Image of the Courseware page in a live course with Staff View indicated
  at top right and a View Unit in Studio button
 
In **Staff View**:

* You see all units that are :ref:`Published and Live`. For units that are
  :ref:`Draft (Unpublished Changes)` or :ref:`Visible to Staff Only`, you
  see the last published version of the unit. You see these units
  regardless of the release dates of the containing section or subsection.

* You do not see units that are :ref:`Draft (Never Published)`. To
  see these units, you must use Preview mode as described in :ref:`Preview
  Course Content`.

* You can access the Instructor Dashboard, which has features and reports that
  help you :ref:`run your course<Running Your Course Index>`.

When you view your course in **Staff View**, you can execute tests to make sure
that your course works the way you intend. For example,  before the release
date of a subsection, members of the course team can work through the problems
to verify that the correct answer gets a green check for correct, and that any
answer other than the correct one gets a red X for incorrect.

============
Student View
============

When viewing your course in the LMS, you can use the **Student** view to see the
course with all course content that is intended for all students.

.. note:: If you have enabled your course for cohorts and have designated some
  content as visible only to certain content groups, you can select a content
  group from the **View Course As** drop down list to see the content exactly
  as a student in a cohort associated with that content group will see it. For
  details, see :ref:`Preview Cohort Specific Courseware`.

To switch to the **Student** view, click **View this course as** and select
**Student** from the drop down list.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/test-view-as-student.png
 :alt: Image of the View Course As drop down list with Staff, Student, and
  named content group options

In **Student View**:

* You do not see sections or subsections that have not yet been released.

* If the section and subsection are released, you see units that are
  :ref:`Published and Live`. For units that are
  :ref:`Draft (Unpublished Changes)`, you see the last published version of the
  unit. 

* You do not see units that are :ref:`Draft (Never Published)` or
  :ref:`Visible to Staff Only`. To see these units, you must switch back to Instructor view or use Preview mode as described in :ref:`Preview Course Content`.

* You can access the Instructor Dashboard, which has features and reports that
  help you run your course.


*************************************
Open Studio from Your Live Course
*************************************

When you are viewing your course in the LMS as **Staff View**, you can open
Studio directly.
   
* In a unit page, click **View Unit in Studio**.
  
  .. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/Live_Studio_from_LMS_Unit.png
   :alt: The View Unit in Studio button in an LMS unit

  The unit page opens in Studio.
 
* In the Instructor Dashboard, click **View Course in Studio** to open the
  course outline.

  For information about the tasks you can complete on the Instructor Dashboard,
  see :ref:`Running Your Course Index`.
 
* In the **Course Progress** page, click **View Grading in Studio** to open the
  Grading page.
