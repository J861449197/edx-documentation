edX课程论坛剖析 
**********************************

====================================
帖子、回复与评论
====================================

::

  帖子：“请各位做个自我介绍吧！”
    - 回复：“我叫Lee，现在在堪培拉，是一名中学数学老师。”
      
    - 回复：“大家好，我叫苏梅，来自中国香港。”
      - 评论：“嗨苏梅，我也在香港上课。组个队不？”
        
      - 评论：“同求组队！希望组队能帮我解决作业问题= =。”
        
    - 回复：“哈喽，我在约翰内斯堡，我在上高考培训班。”
      

本例涵盖了您在讨论中的不同贡献方式。“帖子”即话题，“回复”即对帖子内容的回复，
“评论”则是观众针对某条回复的看法。在发布帖子、发表回复、评论之前，
先想想哪种形式更适合您想表达的内容。这可以让课堂讨论更加井然有序。

====================================
讨论课题
====================================

大多数edX课程都会为学生提供机会讨论视频课程、阅读任务、课后问题及其他课程内容。
这种针对某个特定内容而设的讨论称为“课题”。特殊讨论课题通常出现在相应内容的下方。

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/Discussion_content_specific.png
 :alt: A discussion topic that appears below a video in the course, identified 
       by a "Show Discussion" link

edX课程通常包含几个全课堂讨论课题，譬如“常见问题解答”、“疑难解答”等等。
您可在课程的 **讨论** 页面访问这些课题：单击 所有 **讨论** 下拉箭头即可。

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/Discussion_course_wide.png
 :alt: Discussion topics are listed on the Discussion page when you click the 
       drop-down list at the left side of the page

访问 **讨论** 页面时，您可以阅读这些课题，并在其下发表内容。

* 全课堂讨论课题只有一个标题，其下不包含其他次级讨论内容。

* 特殊讨论课题下通常会包含其他次级分类讨论。


注意，您不仅可以在 **讨论** 页面访问特殊讨论课题，也可以在浏览 **课件** 页面的课程内容时访问特殊讨论课题。
但是全课堂讨论课题只能从 **讨论** 页面访问。

请先浏览课题列表，然后选择最合适的课题发帖，这样能使其他兴趣相投的人更容易找到、阅读、回复您的帖子。


====================================
讨论帖的类型
====================================

当您针对某个课题贡献帖子时，帖子通常分为“提问帖”和“讨论帖”。

* A *question* post raises an issue so that the course staff and community can
  provide answers. 

* A *discussion* post starts a conversation by sharing thoughts and reflections,
  and inviting community participation.

When you add a post to a discussion topic, you must specify whether it is a question
or a discussion. 

After you make your post, on the **Discussion** page for your course, a
question mark image identifies posts that ask questions and a conversation
bubble image identifies posts that start discussions.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/Post_types_in_list.png
 :alt: The list of posts with images identifying questions and discussions 

If you have any difficulty deciding which type of post you want to add, think
about whether you want to get concrete information (a question) or start an
open-ended conversation (a discussion). If you require an answer from the
course team, be sure to create your post as a question, so that the course
team sees that a response is required and responds appropriately.


.. _Find Posts:

******************************
Find Posts
******************************

Finding out whether someone else has already asked the same question or
initiated a conversation about the same subject that interests you, and then
reading and contributing to that exchange instead of starting a new one, helps
make the time that everyone spends with the course discussion more productive.
You can search for something specific, or you can browse through the posts in a
single discussion topic.

=======================
Search the Discussions
=======================

To search for text, click **Discussion** and enter a phrase, a word, or part of
a word in the **Search all posts** field above the list of posts. When you
press Enter, the search tries to find:

* A match or close match to your text in any post, response, or comment. The
  display updates to show a list of the posts that have a match at any level of
  interaction.

* A similar value in any post, response, or comment (if no exact matches are
  found). A "No results found for {text}. Showing results for {similar}"
  message displays above the posts that have similar text at any interaction
  level.

* Any usernames that are an exact match to your text. A "Show posts by
  {username}" option displays above any posts that have an exact text match at
  any interaction level. Click the username in the message to read that user's
  posts, responses, and comments.

==============================================
Review Posts About a Single Topic
==============================================

To review posts about a particular part of the course or type of issue, click
**Discussion** at the top of the page and then select a topic from the drop-
down list. (**All Discussions** is selected by default.) Only posts about the
topic you select appear in the list of posts.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/Discussion_filters.png
 :alt: The list of posts with callouts to identify the top filter to select 
       one topic and the filter below it to select by state 

=======================================
Review Only Unread or Unanswered Posts
=======================================

To limit the posts shown on the **Discussion** page, you can select one of the
filter options. Above the list of posts, the **Show all** filter is selected
by default.

* To list only the discussions and questions that you have not yet viewed,
  select **Unread**.

* To list only question posts that do not yet have any responses marked as
  answers, select **Unanswered**.

.. _Add a Post:

.. _Keep Up with New Activity:

****************************************
Keep Up with New Activity
****************************************

==============================
Read New or Updated Posts
==============================

The list of posts on the **Discussion** page provides visual cues to help you
identify posts that are new, or that have responses or comments that you have
not read yet, and to distinguish them from exchanges that you have already read
completely.

* Posts that you have not read yet have a blue callout image.

* Posts that you have read, but with responses or comments that you have not
  read yet, have a white callout image.
 
* Exchanges that you have read completely have a gray callout image and
  background.

 .. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/Discussion_colorcoding.png
  :alt: The list of posts with posts showing differently colored backgrounds 
        and callout images

The total number of contributions in the exchange (the post and its responses
and comments) appears in each callout image. To see the number of contributions
that you haven't read yet, move your cursor over the callout image.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/Discussion_mouseover.png
 :alt: A post with 4 contributions total and a popup that shows only two are 
       unread 

The color-coded callout images appear when you sort the list of posts **by
recent activity** or **by most activity**. If you sort the list of posts by
most votes instead, the number of votes that the post has received appears in
place of the callouts. See :ref:`Vote for Posts or Responses`.

==============================
Receive Daily Digests
==============================

You have the option to receive an email message each day that summarizes
discussion activity for the posts you are following. To receive this daily
digest, click **Discussion** and then select the **Receive updates** checkbox.


.. _React to Contributions:

************************************
Provide Feedback on Contributions
************************************

As you read the contributions that other students and staff make to discussion
topics, you can provide feedback without writing a complete response or
comment. You can:

* :ref:`Vote for posts and responses<Vote for Posts or Responses>` to provide
  positive feedback.

* :ref:`Follow posts<Follow Posts>` so that you can check back in on
  interesting conversations and questions easily.

* :ref:`Answer questions, and mark your questions as answered<Answer
  Questions>`.

* :ref:`Report a contribution<Report Discussion Misuse>` that is inappropriate
  to the course staff.

To select a feedback option, you use the icons at the top right of each post,
response, or comment. When you move your cursor over these icons a label
appears.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/Discussion_options_mouseover.png
 :alt: The icons at top right of a post, shown before the cursor is 
      placed over each one and with the Vote, Follow, and More labels

topic they apply to, click the drop-down Discussion list and select
**Posts I'm Following**.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/Discussion_filterfollowing.png

       post in the list shows the following indicator.

.. _Answer Questions:

============================================================
