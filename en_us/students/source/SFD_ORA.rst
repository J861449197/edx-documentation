公开互动评判问题
###########################################

在一个公开互动评判问题中，你可以给可能没有简单或确切答案的问题书面解答。在公开互动评判问题中，你也可以提交带有图片的答案。

公开互动评判问题可以包括互评，自评，或两者皆有。 在互评中，你可以对你的同学提交的答案进行评判或者打分，你的同学也可以对你提交的答案进行同样的操作。 在自评中你只可以对自己的答案进行评判。 你需要将待评判的解答与教师给出的参考答案进行比较，来完成评判。

标准答案是一个答案中所应该达到的要求的列表。 标准答案由 *标准* 和 *选项* 组成。 
*标准* 是每个解答所应具有的特点，例如答案所应包含的议题。 *选项* 描述答案符合标准的程度。 下面图片展示了一个参考答案，其包含了两个标准，每个标准下面又有多个选项。

在你评判一个解答时，你需要选择最能描述解答体现标准程度的选项。

有的老师会创建一个 **最佳解答** 单元来展示这个问题的高分答案和其得分。 如果有这个单元，你就能在完成了这个问题的每一步之后，在自己的得分下面查看到它。

============================
Learn to Assess Responses
============================

In this step, you will learn to assess responses effectively by reviewing and
assessing sample responses that the instructor has provided. You will try to
select the same options for the response as the instructor selected.

.. note:: Not all instructors provide sample responses for training. If the
   instructor did provide sample responses, this step does not appear in the
   assignment.

After you submit your response, one of the sample responses opens, together with
the rubric for the assignment. Read the sample response and the rubric
carefully, select the options that you think best reflect the response, and then
click **Compare your selections with the instructor's selections**.

* If all of your selections are the same as the instructor's selections, the
  next sample response opens automatically.

* If any option that you select is not the same as the instructor's selection,
  you see the response again, and the following message appears above the
  response.

.. code-block:: xml

  Learning to Assess Responses
  Your assessment differs from the instructor's assessment of this response. Review the
  response and consider why the instructor may have assessed it differently. Then, try 
  the assessment again.

For each of the criteria, you see one of the following two messages, depending
on whether your selections matched those of the instructor.

.. code-block:: xml

  Selected Options Agree
  The option you selected is the option that the instructor selected.

.. code-block:: xml

  Selected Options Differ
  The option you selected is not the option that the instructor selected.

In the following example, the student chose one correct option and one incorrect
option.

.. image:: /Images/PA_TrainingAssessment_Scored.png
   :alt: Sample training response, scored
   :width: 500

You continue to assess the sample response until the options you select for all
criteria match the options that the instructor selected.

When you have successfully assessed all of the sample responses, you move to the
next step in the assignment.

=====================
Assess Peer Responses
=====================

When the peer assessment step starts, you see each original question, another
student's responses, and the rubric for the assignment. Above the responses you
can see how many responses you are expected to assess and how many you have
already assessed.

.. image:: /Images/PA_S_PeerAssmt.png
   :alt: In-progress peer assessment
   :width: 500

You assess other students' responses by selecting options in the rubric, in the
same way you assessed the sample responses in the "learn to assess responses"
step. Additionally, this step has a field below the rubric where you can provide
comments about the student's responses.

.. note:: Some assessments have an additional **Comments** field for one or more
   of the assessment's individual criteria. You can enter up to 300 characters
   in these fields. In the following image, both criteria have a **Comments**
   field. There is also a field for overall comments on the response.

    .. image:: /Images/PA_CriterionAndOverallComments.png
       :alt: Rubric with comment fields under each criterion and under overall response
       :width: 600

After you have selected options in the rubric and provided additional comments
about the responses, click **Submit your assessment and move to response
#<number>**.

When you submit your assessment of the first student's responses, another set of
responses opens for you. Assess these responses in the same way that you
assessed the first student's responses, and then submit your assessment. You
will repeat these steps until you have assessed the required number of
responses. The number in the upper-right corner of the step is updated as you
assess each set of responses.

Assess Additional Peer Responses
********************************

You can assess more peer responses if you want to. After you assess the required
number of responses, the step "collapses" so that only the **Assess Peers**
heading is visible.

.. image:: /Images/PA_PAHeadingCollapsed.png
   :width: 500
   :alt: The peer assessment step with just the heading visible

To assess more responses, click the **Assess Peers** heading to expand the step,
then click **Continue Assessing Peers**.

.. image:: /Images/PA_ContinueGrading.png
   :width: 500
   :alt: The peer assessment step expanded so that "Continue Assessing Peers" is visible


=====================
Assess Your Response
=====================

When you have completed the required number of peer assessments, your self
assessment opens. You see your responses along with the same rubric that you
used in the peer assessment step. Assess your responses, then click **Submit
Your Assessment**.

==========================================
Receive Your Score and Provide Feedback
==========================================

After you submit your self assessment, if other students are still assessing
your responses, you see the following message under the **Assess Your Response**
step.

.. code-block:: xml

  Your Grade: Waiting for Peer Assessment

  Your response is still undergoing peer assessment. After your peers have assessed your
  response, you'll see their feedback and receive your final grade.

If you see this message, keep checking back periodically until the peer
assessments of your work are complete.

When peer assessment is complete, you can see the scores you received from all
of your peers, as well as your self assessment. You can also see any additional
comments that your peers have provided.

.. image:: /Images/PA_AllScores.png
   :alt: A student's response with peer and self assessment scores
   :width: 550

If you want to, you can provide feedback on the scores that you received under **Provide Feedback on Peer Assessments**.

=================================================
Assess Additional Peer Responses (optional)
=================================================

If you have assessed the required number of peer responses and completed your
self assessment, you can assess additional peer responses. To do this, click the
**Assess Peers** heading. If any responses remain to be assessed, a new response
opens.

***********************
Peer Assessment Scoring
***********************

Peer assessments are scored by criteria. An individual criterion's score is the
*median*, not average, of the scores that each peer assessor gave that
criterion. For example, if the Ideas criterion in a peer assessment receives a
10 from one student, a 7 from a second student, and an 8 from a third student,
the Ideas criterion's score is 8.

Your final score for a peer assessment is the sum of the median scores for each individual criterion. 

For example, a response might receive the following scores from peer assessors.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 10 10 10 10
   :stub-columns: 1
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Criterion Name
     - Peer 1
     - Peer 2
     - Peer 3
     - Median
   * - Ideas (out of 10)
     - 10
     - 7
     - 8
     - **8**
   * - Content (out of 10)
     - 7
     - 9
     - 8
     - **8**
   * - Grammar (out of 5)
     - 4
     - 4
     - 5
     - **4**

To calculate the final score, the system adds the median scores for each criterion:

  **Ideas median (8/10) + Content median (8/10) + Grammar median (4/5) = final score (20/25)**

Note, again, that your final score is not the median of the scores that each individual peer assessor gave the response.

==================================
View Top Responses (optional)
==================================

If the instructor has included a **Top Responses** section, you can see the
highest-scoring responses that your peers have submitted. This section only
appears after you have completed all the steps of the assignment.

.. image:: /Images/PA_TopResponses.png
   :alt: Section that shows the text and scores of the top three responses for the assignment
   :width: 500


********************************
Cancelled Responses
********************************

If the instructor deems a response that you have submitted to be inappropriate,
she can cancel that response and remove it from peer grading. In the open
response assessment you see an indicator that your submission was cancelled,
with the date and time of the cancellation, and a comment by the instructor
about the reason.

The instructor might allow you to submit a replacement response for the
cancelled one, or she might not. If she does not allow you to submit a
replacement response, your grade is zero for the assignment.
