.. _Add a Post:

==============
创建一个帖子
==============

当你在课程中的讨论创建一个帖子时，你要考虑决定帖子的种类，帖子的话题。 之后你可以直接将帖子添加进课程单元或者 **讨论** 页面。

.. _Determine Post Type:

**************************************************
决定帖子的类型：讨论或者提问
**************************************************

为了确保别的同学或者课程团队能够看到并回复你的帖子，你需要决定你的帖子是讨论类型还是提问类型。

* *问题* 帖子提出一个问题，负责讨论部分的员工或者社区会做出解答。 

* *讨论* 帖子发起一个对话，可以在其中分享想法和思考，还可以邀请社区参与。

如果你无法决定你将要创建的帖子的种类，仔细想想你想要得到直接的信息（问题），还是开始一段开放的对话（讨论）。 如果你需要课程团队来解答课程问题，切记将帖子创建为问题，这样课程团队就能看到有问题需要答复并及时作出回复。

在你制作好自己的帖子后，在你课程的 **讨论** 页面上，帖子的种类由图标表示，问号代表问题，对话框代表讨论。

.. note::你可以在帖子创建之后改换帖子的类型。 获得更多信息请查看
   :ref:`Edit or Delete`.
   

.. _Determine Post Topic:

*************************
Determine the Post Topic
*************************

Every post in the course discussions has an associated topic. The course team
creates the list of discussion topics for each course, and you'll choose a topic
from the list when you create your post. Before you add a post, you should look
through the list of topics in the course discussions so that you can decide
which topic is the most appropriate for your post. For more information, see
:ref:`Explore Posts`.

After you've decided on a post type and topic, you can add your post on the
**Discussion** page or in the body of the course.

************************************
